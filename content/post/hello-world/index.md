Hello and welcome to my cloud tech blog! 

I'm excited to have you here and to share my knowledge and insights on all things cloud computing. But first, let me introduce myself. My name is Aksel Skaar Leirvaag and I'm really excited for the fascinating technologies and the opportunities that the cloud ecosystem offers. I've a Bachelor's degree in digital infrastructure and cyber security, and previously worked as a full-stack developer, however, at the moment I'm exploring the fields of DevOps and Platform Engineering.

On this blog, you can expect to find a range of topics related to cloud computing, such as me tinkering with new technologies, technical deep dives, and personal experiences acquired while working in the sector. I hope you find the blog to be informative and useful. Please contact me if you have any questions or suggestions for subjects to be covered. 

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the future! ðŸš€
